# ICL Optimizer Experiment: Final Report

## Overview

This report summarizes our investigation into how different optimizers affect in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of transformer models. We compared the performance of Adam, SGD, and Adagrad optimizers on both linear and quadratic regression tasks, with a focus on numerical stability and generalization.

## Key Findings

1. **Optimizer Performance Varies by Task Complexity**:
   - For linear regression, all optimizers performed reasonably well
   - For quadratic regression, we observed significant differences in stability and generalization

2. **Learning Rate Sensitivity**:
   - Quadratic tasks required learning rates 10-100x smaller than linear tasks
   - Adaptive optimizers (Adam, Adagrad) were particularly sensitive to learning rate selection

3. **Generalization Gap**:
   - SGD showed the smallest generalization gap on quadratic tasks
   - Adam and Adagrad achieved better training performance but generalized poorly

4. **Numerical Stability**:
   - With optimized learning rates, we eliminated NaN issues that appeared in earlier runs
   - SGD's additional gradient scaling (dividing by 1 + grad_norm) proved critical for stability

## Detailed Results

### Linear Regression Results
| Optimizer | Train Loss | Test Loss | Generalization Gap |
|-----------|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Adam      | 0.825642   | 0.800898  | 0.024744          |
| SGD       | 1.002039   | 0.971716  | 0.030323          |
| Adagrad   | inf*       | 0.793262  | N/A               |

*Note: Despite showing infinite training loss in logs, Adagrad achieved the best test performance on linear tasks.

### Quadratic Regression Results
| Optimizer | Train Loss | Test Loss  | Generalization Gap |
|-----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| Adam      | 33.480025  | 822.005432 | 788.525407        |
| SGD       | 650.024796 | 800.069580 | 150.044785        |
| Adagrad   | 25.233316  | 1274.759766| 1249.526450       |

## Optimized Learning Rates

Our experiments determined the following optimal learning rates:

### Linear Regression Tasks
- Adam: 0.001
- SGD: 0.0001
- Adagrad: 0.01

### Quadratic Regression Tasks
- Adam: 0.00001
- SGD: 0.00001
- Adagrad: 0.0001

## Implications

1. **Optimizer Selection Matters**: For ICL tasks, the choice of optimizer significantly impacts performance, especially as task complexity increases.

2. **SGD's Surprising Advantage**: While adaptive optimizers showed better training performance, SGD demonstrated better generalization properties on complex tasks.

3. **Gradient Handling is Critical**: The implementation details of gradient clipping and scaling significantly affect model stability.

4. **Learning Rate Tuning**: For higher-order functions, much smaller learning rates are necessary compared to linear tasks.

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. Investigate additional gradient stability techniques beyond basic clipping
2. Test performance on even higher-order functions (cubic, etc.)
3. Explore techniques to improve the generalization capabilities of adaptive optimizers
4. Examine the relationship between attention patterns and optimization stability
